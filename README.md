FANET Load-Based Handover and Cooperative Offloading System (NS-3 Simulation)

Overview This project is a simulation-based system for studying reliable communication in Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs). It models multiple drones communicating with ground base stations while maintaining connectivity under mobility, signal degradation, and network congestion. The system implements intelligent handover management, load balancing, and cooperative relay-based offloading to ensure Quality of Service (QoS). The simulation uses a hybrid decision mechanism combining signal strength, network load, and emergency conditions.

Key Features

Load-Based Handover Drones dynamically switch between base stations based on signal strength and current network load to maintain optimal connectivity.

Urgent Handover Mechanism Triggers immediate handover when signal quality drops near receiver sensitivity, preventing sudden disconnection.

Cooperative Relay Offloading When direct communication weakens, nearby drones act as temporary relay nodes to forward data to the base station.

Optimal Relay Selection Relay drones are chosen based on distance, elevation angle, and signal quality to maximize communication efficiency.

Ping-Pong Prevention Hysteresis and dwell-time constraints reduce unnecessary frequent handovers between base stations.

Performance Monitoring Tracks detailed metrics including handover counts, throughput, connection time, and network availability.

System Architecture The system follows a layered simulation architecture:

Drone Layer Mobile UAV nodes generating traffic and performing handovers.

Base Station Layer Ground stations providing connectivity with limited capacity.

Relay Layer Selected drones acting as micro base stations for offloaded clients.

Network Layer Implements routing, communication channels, and signal propagation models.

Metrics & Logging Module Collects performance statistics and generates output files.

Workflow

Drone initially connects to the nearest base station Signal strength and load conditions are continuously monitored If signal weakens or BS becomes overloaded: â�� Normal handover to a better BS, or â�� Urgent handover if near disconnection, or â�� Offloading via relay drone if no BS is suitable Relay forwards data to the base station System logs performance metrics throughout the simulation
